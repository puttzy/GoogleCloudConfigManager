# Google Cloud config manager

### caveat: I hate writing bash.  I'm not good at it. Never spent the time to learn how to do it well. I just make it work


I created this little utility bash script to help manage variable and configurations in [Google cloud runtime configurator](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/)
